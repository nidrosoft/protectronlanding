As of February 2025, companies using prohibited AI practices face fines up to €35 million or 7% of global annual revenue. And by August 2026, any company with high-risk AI systems that isn't compliant faces penalties up to €15 million.

This isn't a theoretical future risk. **Enforcement has begun.**

Here's what you need to know about EU AI Act penalties, what triggers them, and how to protect your company.

## The Penalty Structure at a Glance

The EU AI Act establishes a three-tier penalty system based on the severity of violations:

| Tier | Maximum Fine | Revenue % | Violation Type |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | €35 Million | 7% | Prohibited AI practices |
| **Tier 2** | €15 Million | 3% | High-risk non-compliance |
| **Tier 3** | €7.5 Million | 1.5% | False information |

The penalty is always calculated as whichever amount is **higher** — the fixed sum or the revenue percentage.

### Example Calculations

**Company with €500M annual revenue:**
- Prohibited AI violation: Up to €35 million
- High-risk non-compliance: Up to €15 million

**Company with €1B annual revenue:**
- Prohibited AI violation: Up to **€70 million** (7% exceeds fixed)
- High-risk non-compliance: Up to **€30 million** (3% exceeds fixed)

The math gets painful very quickly for larger organizations.

## What Triggers the Maximum Penalties?

### €35 Million: Prohibited AI Practices

The harshest penalties are reserved for AI systems that should never have been deployed in the first place.

**You face maximum penalties if you:**

- **Deploy social scoring systems** that evaluate people based on social behavior for detrimental treatment
- **Use real-time biometric identification** (facial recognition) in public spaces without authorization
- **Implement emotion recognition** in workplaces or educational settings
- **Build AI designed to manipulate** vulnerable groups like children or elderly
- **Create biometric categorization systems** that infer sensitive attributes (race, religion, sexual orientation)
- **Use predictive policing** that assesses crime probability based on personal profiling
- **Scrape facial images** from the internet or CCTV to build recognition databases

> ⚠️ **These practices were banned on February 2, 2025.** There is no compliance pathway — they are simply prohibited.

**Real-world implications:** If your HR department uses an AI tool that detects employee emotions to assess "engagement" or "productivity," you may already be in violation. If your security system uses real-time facial recognition without explicit legal authorization, you're exposed.

### €15 Million: High-Risk Non-Compliance

The second tier of penalties applies to high-risk AI systems that fail to meet the comprehensive requirements under Articles 9-15.

**You face these penalties if your high-risk AI:**

- Lacks a documented risk management system
- Has no technical documentation
- Doesn't maintain proper records and logs
- Fails to provide transparency information to users
- Has no human oversight measures
- Hasn't undergone conformity assessment
- Isn't registered in the EU database (when required)
- Doesn't meet accuracy and robustness standards

**High-risk AI includes systems used for:**

- Recruitment and hiring decisions
- Credit scoring and lending
- Insurance pricing and claims
- Educational admissions and grading
- Healthcare diagnosis and treatment recommendations
- Law enforcement and legal proceedings
- Border control and immigration

> 📅 **Deadline: August 2, 2026** — The deadline for full high-risk compliance.

### €7.5 Million: Providing False Information

The "lightest" penalty tier still carries significant fines for:

- Providing incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information to authorities
- Failing to cooperate with regulatory requests
- Submitting false documentation during conformity assessments

## How Fines Are Calculated

The EU AI Act provides guidance on how authorities should determine actual penalty amounts within these maximums.

### Factors that increase penalties:

- Intentional or negligent violation
- Previous violations of the AI Act
- Duration of the violation
- Number of people affected
- Severity of harm caused
- Lack of cooperation with authorities
- Financial benefits gained from the violation

### Factors that may reduce penalties:

- Proactive remediation efforts
- First-time offense
- Good faith attempts at compliance
- Cooperation with investigators
- Limited scope of violation
- Voluntary disclosure of issues

### SME Considerations

For small and medium enterprises (and startups), the regulation calls for "proportionate" penalties. However, this doesn't mean immunity — it means regulators should consider company size when setting fines within the allowable range. A €1 million fine might be proportionate for a startup, while €35 million would be reserved for larger offenders. But **€1 million is still company-ending for many startups**.

## Who Enforces the EU AI Act?

Enforcement happens at multiple levels:

### National Authorities

Each EU member state designates national competent authorities to enforce the AI Act within their borders. These authorities can:

- Conduct investigations and audits
- Request documentation and information
- Issue compliance orders
- Impose fines and penalties
- Order AI systems to be withdrawn from the market

### The AI Office

The European Commission's AI Office coordinates enforcement across member states and directly oversees:

- General-purpose AI (GPAI) model compliance
- Cross-border enforcement coordination
- Development of codes of practice
- Guidance and interpretation

### Market Surveillance

Market surveillance authorities monitor AI systems in the market and can:

- Request access to AI systems for testing
- Order recalls or withdrawals
- Issue public warnings about non-compliant systems

## Enforcement Has Already Begun

While we haven't yet seen major EU AI Act fines make headlines, enforcement infrastructure is now active:

### What's happening now:

- National authorities are being designated across EU member states
- The AI Office is operational and issuing guidance
- Prohibited practices are being monitored
- Complaints mechanisms are being established

### What to expect:

Based on GDPR enforcement patterns, we can anticipate:

- Initial focus on clear-cut violations (prohibited AI)
- High-profile enforcement actions to establish precedent
- Gradual increase in enforcement intensity
- Cross-border coordination on major cases

> ⚠️ **Companies Most at Risk:** The companies most at risk are those with obvious violations — social scoring, unauthorized biometric systems, or workplace emotion recognition that haven't been discontinued.

## Beyond Fines: Other Consequences

Financial penalties aren't the only risk. Non-compliance can trigger:

### Market Withdrawal Orders

Authorities can order non-compliant AI systems to be removed from the EU market entirely. For companies dependent on EU customers, this is existential.

### Reputational Damage

Enforcement actions are public. Being known as a company that violated AI regulations damages trust with customers, partners, and investors.

### Contract Terminations

Enterprise customers increasingly include AI compliance requirements in contracts. Non-compliance can trigger termination clauses and loss of major accounts.

### Insurance & Liability

D&O insurance and cyber insurance policies may not cover penalties from willful non-compliance. Executives could face personal liability.

## How to Protect Your Company

Avoiding EU AI Act penalties requires proactive compliance. Here's what to do:

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

- **Audit for prohibited AI** — Check if any of your systems fall into the banned categories. If they do, discontinue immediately.
- **Inventory your AI systems** — Create a complete list of all AI you develop, deploy, or use.
- **Initial classification** — Determine which systems are high-risk, limited-risk, or minimal-risk.

### Short-Term Actions (This Month)

- **Risk assessment** — For high-risk systems, begin documenting risks and mitigation measures.
- **Gap analysis** — Compare your current practices against EU AI Act requirements.
- **Compliance roadmap** — Create a timeline to address gaps before the August 2026 deadline.

### Ongoing Actions

- **Documentation** — Build and maintain required technical documentation.
- **Implement controls** — Establish human oversight, logging, and monitoring.
- **Prepare for conformity assessment** — Gather evidence you'll need for self-assessment or third-party audit.
- **Stay informed** — Monitor regulatory guidance and update practices accordingly.

## The Cost of Compliance vs. Non-Compliance

Let's be direct about the math:

### Cost of Proactive Compliance

- Compliance software: €1,000-12,000/year
- Documentation effort: Weeks of internal work
- Process changes: Manageable operational adjustments

### Cost of Non-Compliance

- Fines: Up to €35 million
- Market withdrawal: Loss of EU revenue
- Reputation damage: Incalculable
- Legal fees: Hundreds of thousands
- Business disruption: Months of firefighting

The choice is obvious. Companies that invest in compliance now are buying insurance against catastrophic outcomes.

## Common Mistakes That Lead to Penalties

Based on how similar regulations have been enforced, here are the mistakes most likely to trigger EU AI Act penalties:

### 1. Assuming "We're Not in the EU"

If you have EU customers, users, or your AI affects EU residents, you're in scope. Location of headquarters is irrelevant.

### 2. Ignoring the Prohibited List

Some companies have deployed emotion recognition or social scoring features without realizing they're banned. Ignorance isn't a defense.

### 3. Misclassifying Risk Levels

Incorrectly classifying a high-risk system as minimal-risk to avoid compliance requirements will be treated harshly when discovered.

### 4. Documentation Gaps

"We do all the right things but didn't document them" won't protect you. The EU AI Act requires written evidence of compliance.

### 5. Waiting Until the Deadline

Compliance requires significant preparation. Starting in July 2026 for an August 2026 deadline is a recipe for failure — and penalties.

### 6. Assuming Third-Party AI Is Someone Else's Problem

Using OpenAI or AWS doesn't transfer your compliance obligations. Deployers have their own requirements.

## Timeline to Penalty Exposure

Here's when different penalties become enforceable:

| Date | What Becomes Enforceable |
|------|-------------------------|
| **February 2, 2025** | ✅ Prohibited AI penalties (€35M tier) — **NOW ACTIVE** |
| **August 2, 2025** | ✅ GPAI non-compliance penalties — **NOW ACTIVE** |
| **August 2, 2026** | High-risk AI penalties (€15M tier) |
| **August 2, 2027** | Embedded AI in regulated products |

## Take Action Now

The EU AI Act is not a future concern — it's a present reality. Companies that act now will:

- Avoid catastrophic fines
- Maintain market access
- Build competitive advantage through compliance
- Protect their reputation

**Don't wait for enforcement to find you.** Start your compliance journey today.
